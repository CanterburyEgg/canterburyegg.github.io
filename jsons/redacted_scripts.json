        "snippet": "INTERSTELLAR Written by Jonathan Nolan STORY BY Jonathan Nolan, Kip Thorne & Lynda Obst MARCH 12 2008 SPACE. But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy. Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters... planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut? Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of existence itself: a BLACK HOLE. The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl, spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES. The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves, racing back out from the black hole. Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal- like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe -- a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own. The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and through the roof of a nondescript warehouse. The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected in a heavy piece of glass. The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert. An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV. INT. CONTROL ROOM, WAREHOUSE -- DAY The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission Control. He pours himself a cup of coffee. It is the weekend and the place is empty.

A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He COLLAPSES. The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE. INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.

The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID, BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville Mississippi.

BONASERA I raised my daughter in the American fashion; I gave her freedom, but taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a boy friend, not an Italian. She went to the movies with him, stayed out late. Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted; she kept her honor. So they beat her like an animal. When I went to the hospital her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered and held together by wire, and she could not even weep because of the pain. He can barely speak; he is weeping now. BONASERA I went to the Police like a good American. These two boys were arrested and brought to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence. Suspended sentence! They went free that very day. I stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those bastards, they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, for Justice, we must go to The Godfather.

Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I said, ''Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.'' or anything like that. I mean, you tell me you're a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good. MR. INCREDIBLE No matter how many times you save the world, it always manages to get back in jeopardy again. Sometimes I just want it to stay saved, you know? For a little bit. I feel like the maid. ''I just cleaned up this mess. Can we keep it clean for ten minutes?'' INTERVIEWER I could get to that point. MR. INCREDIBLE ''Please?'' INTERVIEWER Wait, no, don't get up. We're not finished. MR. INCREDIBLE Sometimes l think I'd just like the simple life, you know? Relax a little and raise a family. ELASTIGIRL Settle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game! I'm right up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don't think so. I don't think so. __________________________________________SCENE 2__________________________________________ POLICE RADIO "

Assured the coast is clear, the SINISTER RAT scampers out into the yard, followed by DOZENS MORE RATS. The RATS move across the expanse of grass toward a COMPOST HEAP, which sits in the middle of a field under the darkening sky. Resourceful and well coordinated, the rats grab bits of decomposing food and carry it off. REMY is among them, drearily going through garbage. 3. REMY (V.O.)

The DOOR then springs open - it\u2019s JIM HUTTON (FREDDIE\u2019s long-term partner and carer) running, heart-broken, through the upstairs rooms of Freddie\u2019s mansion, finally stopping at the top of the stairs, as - - the front door opens. It\u2019s MARY AUSTIN (40) entering, breathless, with her own key. She looks up the stairs, at JIM, who is standing there, tearful, grief-stricken. MARY catches her breath. Her face starts to crumple as JIM\u2019s expression delivers the tragic news. MARY puts down her bags and climbs the stairs, stopping to steady herself, until she and JIM hug, hold hands, then move together toward the distant bedroom and a big round bed lit from above by a column of daylight. On the bed, distantly, we can just make out a still FIGURE over which JIM and MARY bend... MARY Freddie?! Oh no, oh no! INT.

CAR - CONTINUOUS 2 Play is pressed on an iPod Classic. A rock track starts up. It\u2019s very loud. It\u2019s awesome. \u2018Bellbottoms\u2019 by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. On high strings and a guitar stab we see the driver. Young, baby faced. Short cropped hair. He wears mostly black. Sports cheap gas station shades. This is BABY. We can\u2019t see his eyes, but his blank expression seems pretty stoic. He listens to the track, stares out the windshield. On a 2nd guitar stab we see a beefy (30s) tough guy in shotgun. This is GRIFF. He too wears shades, black business clothes. On a 3rd stab we see another black clad gentleman. (40s) He\u2019s handsome, but looks like he parties too hard. This is BUDDY. On a final stab we see the last shades wearing black clad passenger, a younger lady (20s) with her hair up. This is DARLING. There\u2019s a hint of trash beneath her business clothes. The high strings crescendo. Griff flings his door wide open. 3 INT./EXT. CAR/PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 3 The track kicks in. We see the car is a shiny red Honda Civic and note the door chimes are in time with the song. Choppy strings play against guitar riffs as GRIFF gets out. We see a shotgun partially concealed in his trench coat. BUDDY and DARLING get out. We glimpse they are also armed. He pops the trunk. Grabs two duffels. Hands one to Darling. We see they all wear sneakers as they walk away from the car in sync with the track. Again. It\u2019s awesome. But we stay with- 2. BABY: our young driver. Hands fixed on the wheel. Ten to two. Watching his colleagues disappearing inside a \u2018CHASE\u2019 bank. The song pauses for two bars. When it kicks back in, our driver suddenly drops the strong, silent tough guy act and comes to glorious, joyous life. Nodding his head. Swaying in his seat. Mouthing the vocals. A slave to the rhythm. He doesn\u2019t miss a beat. It\u2019s "

Like all images of Earth seen from space, this image of our planet is mythical and majestic. The globe seems almost tangible, slowly spinning, floating in the endless void of space.

Here it is completely silent. SILENCE- IN THE DISTANCE- A small metal object crosses the empty space surrounding Earth. If it appears to be a small satellite that is only because it is far away from us. It is the size of one football field. It is- The INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS). It resembles a dragonfly. Its solar panels stretch out, like wings, from the long body made of connected pressurized modules. It floats with a sense of proud achievement. It orbits at an altitude of 500 km above sea level. It moves at an average of 27,700 kilometers per hour, completing 15.7 laps around the Earth per day. It is cruising over Zimbabwe. To the East, the island of Madagascar. Up to the North, the expansive dry lands of Somalia and Ethiopia. Soon, the ISS curves around the spherical planet, and it becomes smaller, almost indistinguishable, no more than a small bright spec grazing over the blue atmosphere.

The accompanying MUSIC is jaunty but mysterious -- we're clearly in for a ride. We emerge as the chocolate pours into a mold, one of hundreds inching along a conveyor belt. This isn't any ordinary factory. Bathed in amber light, the machinery is ornate and polished, with shiny brass joints and spindly levers. Complicated gears tug on oiled canvas ropes, slipping through swinging pulleys. As the chocolate bars continue along the belt, great bellows swell and gently PUFF on them. A moment later, a press SLAMS down, lifting to reveal the word it has imprinted: W O N K A Still moving, we look back along the belt as hundreds of bars line up to be stamped. The molds suddenly flip over, dumping each bar onto its own set of wire fingers. These \u201chands\u201d zip straight up along an elevator track. We RISE with them, a good hundred feet up, getting a bird's eye view of the factory floor. It's quite dark except for the golden lights right along the machinery itself. Strangely, we don't see a single person working. As the chocolate reaches the tip-top of the track, a mechanical arm THWACKS a small package to the underside of each bar. Just as suddenly, the track flings each bar over the top. The candy bars plummet in free-fall, until the tiny packages pop open, revealing parachutes. Their descent slows until a pair of giant scissors deftly SNIPS the strings on each chute, leaving the candy to drop onto another conveyor belt. Each piece of chocolate lands perfectly square on its own sheet of foil paper. Looking ahead, we can see the machine that bends the foil around the chocolate. But before we get there, A HUMAN HAND reaches in and lifts five bars off the belt. (CONTINUED) 2.

The maiden twirls on pointe, a smile on her face, light as air and carefree. She pauses, her face grows worried. Sensing someone watching. Scared, she peers into the darkness. She moves now, looking, growing more frantic. Then, a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind her. She stumbles backwards, frightened. She tries to escape, twirling away, but he pursues. His true form is revealed, the demon ROTHBART. He flings his open hand towards her, casting the spell. She wants to scream, but nothing comes out. She looks at her body, sensing something happening to her. Something terrifying. She spins, panicking, but it's too late. She disappears beneath the beast's cape. She emerges as the WHITE SWAN, the iconic protagonist of SWAN LAKE. CUT TO BLACK. 2 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2 In the darkness, a pair of EYES. They belong to NINA, the same dancer.

He was caught in the cellars with enough gunpowder to level most of London. Guy sees lanterns coming from both sides. He tries to run as the dogs reach him first. He grabs for his sword as dozens of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall. EVEY (V.O.) Sometimes I wonder where we would be if he hadn't failed. I wonder if it would have mattered. In the dim pre-dawn light, Guy is led to the gallows. EVEY (V.O.) I suppose the answer is in the rhyme. More than the man, what we must remember is the plot itself. The coarse noose of rope is snugged up to Guy's throat. He looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face, staring up at him. EVEY (V.O.) For in the plot we find more than just a man, we find the idea of that man, the spirit of that man, and that is what we must never forget. The lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling down her face. EVEY (V.O.)

Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern. WATSON (V.O.) I had come to London, ten years prior, to find a life after the Afghan war. I had hoped to start a medical practice and settle into a nice, steady existence. The life I found was anything but nice and steady. We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable.

Landscapes slide by. Reduced by altitude to abstractions: river deltas, forests and flood plains. A raw natural world. No trace of civilization. The shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. Across an ocean and a pale beach. Over lowland plain at the foot of a VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN it stops. EXT. LOWLAND PLAIN - DAY THREE FIGURES walk out of the shadow. They are men - and yet not men. Their skin is snow-white. Their features heavy and classical - as if Rodin's Thinker had risen from his seat. Their smooth heads are earless and hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black. Against the stark land their height is impossible to judge. They are ENGINEERS. Two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design. The third is naked. One of the cloaked Engineers opens a featureless black box: inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material. The naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness. It hums and buzzes. Foams into iridescent spheres. He raises the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament. BLACK SCARABS boil out of the dark material. Swarm over his lips. Glittering insects that chitter and bite. Under the swarm his lips melt away. A horrific vision of teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. They are devouring him. FLASH ON: A fevered glimpse of the microscopic: cells rupture and bleed. Protein chains unfold. A DNA spiral unravels. 2. The scarabs fill their bellies with genetic material. THE ENGINEER ...spreads his arms. Stands cruciform, nearly headless. The scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest. When they reach his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a felled tree. Engulfed. The two cloaked Engineers watch impassively. Behind them, a vast black SHIP hangs in the sky. As if blown by a great gust of wind, the scarabs disperse in their millions in all directions. Living DNA on th"

Grandfather was a lawman. Father too. Me and him was sheriff at the same time, him in Plano and me here. I think he was pretty proud of that. I know I was. EXT.

Nigger Hoskins over in Bastrop County knowed everbody's phone number off by heart. You can't help but compare yourself against the old- timers. Can't help but wonder how they would've operated these times. There was this boy I sent to the gas chamber at Huntsville here a while back. My arrest and my testimony.

Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. The pan has brought into frame the flashing light bars of a police car stopped on the shoulder. A young sheriff's deputy is opening the rear door on the far side of the car. VOICE OVER Said he knew he was going to hell. Be there in about fifteen minutes. I don't know what to make of that.

The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It's winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart. NARRATOR (V.O.) It has been said that magic vanished from our world a long time ago. And that humanity can no longer fulfill its desires through the power of wishes. To those who have lost the wondrous vision of childhood eyes, submitted here is the story of a little boy, and a magical Christmas wish that changed his life forever. EXT./ESTAB. A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING NARRATOR (V.O.) It began in 1985, in a town just outside Boston. We see a GROUP OF KIDS laughing and tossing snowballs at each other in the street. NARRATOR (V.O.) It was Christmas Eve, and all the children were in high spirits. That special time of year when Boston children gather together and beat up the Jewish kids. Another little kid walks out of his house with a sled, and starts walking up the street. One of the snowball- throwing kids points at the sled kid. KID #1 Hey, Greenbaum! GREENBAUM Uh oh. KID #1 It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow! You know what I'm gonna get him? GREENBAUM W...what? (CONTINUED) 2 CONTINUED: KID #1 My fist in your fuckin' face! GREENBAUM Why would Jesus want that? KID #2 Get him! The kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle him. Another boy, JOHN BENNETT (about 8 years old, shy and innocent-looking) approaches the melee. NARRATOR (V.O.) But there was one child who wasn't in such good spirits. Little John Bennett. That one boy in every neighborhood who just has a tough time making friends. JOHN Hey guys, can I play? The kids all look at him. KID #1/#2/#3 Get outta here! / Get outta here, Bennett! / Get lost, Bennett!"

Judson\u2019s leading the team toward a two-story, English styled farm house with a covered porch in the distance. Maple and Hickory trees tower around it. Dull light stabs out from several windows. Smoke plumes from the fireplace. A large barn stands fifty yards away. Lightening cracks across a violent, dark sky, as sunrise is just starting to break through the horizon.

The sheer scope of it sinks in: the blank slate of nature, the absence of man. On the screen superimpose: MARFA, TEXAS, 1993. CREDITS BEGIN. A plume of dust comes into frame. The dust is from a TRUCK, orange and white and violet, with \"FedEx\" blazoned across the side. The truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II era Quonset huts and outbuildings. Around the outbuildings are large sculptures of wood and metal. EXT. QUONSET HUT - DAY The door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties. Hair pulled back, casual, an artist. She hands the DRIVER a FedEx BOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS. The Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer dangles from his belt. The Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer, prints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go. But something on the box catches her eye. She wants it back. He glances at his watch. She draws RINGS around the Wings, uniting them. She gives the box to the Driver, then hands him a cup of coffee. They've done this before. He takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck. He jumps in and heads back onto the plains. EXT. FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLAND/ODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER The Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a dolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides. A female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the container, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt of rollers onto a larger truck. The doors of the truck close. The latch slams down. A forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737. EXT. MEMPHIS AIRPORT SUPERHUB - NIGHT The 737 lands. EXT.

He throws the door to reveal a mass of huddled and frightened people inside. The words are not necessary. The language is not ours and the images say enough. Men, women and children are herded off the train like cattle toward a large open yard. There they huddle until the Germans begin to shout and shove through the mob. EXT. FENCE CORRIDOR - DAY We are looking up at rows and rows of fences topped with barbed wire all designed to create a separator for the thousands of Jew who pour through each day. Then we see the eyes themselves that look up at them. A LITTLE BOY. A boy who will not die this day. A boy who will live to see the end of the war and the world of the future. He stares at the metal wire with an unusual fascination. The boy looks up at HIS WORRIED PARENTS - a sturdy- looking couple who try to smile and comfort him. The corridor comes to a junction where it splits in several different directions. Soldiers here push the mob using rifles as pikes, screaming and terrorizing the lot of them. Suddenly it is clear what they are doing. They are dividing the mob into smaller groups. Soon, the groups themselves become evident. Men from women. Children from adults. The family tries to stay together, clinging to one another dearly, until finally, they are put upon by a number of gray uniforms and pulled apart. The boy is dragged screaming his feet no longer touching the ground. Two soldiers carry him as they follow the back of a large column of children being led through a gate of barbed wire so dense, it resembles wool. The gate closes and the boy looks back to see his parents - along with many others - being restrained by a number of soldiers. The screaming is deafening. And the boy's can be heard above it all. The soldiers seem to be having a hard time carrying such a frail child. The farther they get from the fence"

At least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.

In attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense that for the most part they are people of means. The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a REEL. The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon, having cut directly from the tune he was previously playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no way seems possessed with empty servitude. Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear that despite their respective races there is much admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities. INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING It is a Saturday morning.

Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge. Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring. WALT Jesus Christ. Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from across the pews. MITCH Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley. He can't even tone it down at Mom's funeral? STEVE What do you expect? Dad's still living in the \ufffd50s. He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly. MITCH Yeah, well your kid's wearing a Timberwolves jersey. I'm sure Dad appreciates that. STEVE My point is that there's nothing anyone can do that won't disappoint the Old Man. (CONTINUED) PAGE 3 It's inevitable. That's why we stopped doing Thanksgivings; the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath, it's always something. MITCH What are we going to do with him? Don't you think he'll get in trouble by himself over in the old neighborhood? STEVE Why don't you have him move in with you? MITCH Ha ha. INT. CHURCH - LATER The choir sings the Beatitudes. Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish. FATHER JANOVICH, the very young parish priest, steps up to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife. Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak, unconvincing words of Father Janovich. FATHER JANOVICH Death..."

INT. CLUB ENTRANCE 2. From the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty face: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat- up American baseball cap. Sneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns and silk suits, heading toward the music in the main ballroom. 3. INT. THE BALLROOM 3. Short Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub. On the stage, he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around the pagoda. Now, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke and its enormous jaws open. Out of the dragon's mouth walks the star of the stage show: WILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or- chestra wails the accompaniment. But Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames. He surveys the rich Chinese, American and European revelers. Jewels flash and champagne flows. Short Round finally spots a table of somber-looking Chinese men in suits. Short Round chews gum and stares at the men. Then he turns to go. WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short Round leave. 4. INT. CLUB ENTRANCE 4. As Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man in a tuxedo entering the club. Short Round looks up at the man, but we don't see his face. Then Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door- man hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults all the way. A maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-check girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom.

We wake groggily with JACK (five), blinking up at MA (26). She's standing in a worn t-shirt and underwear beside a lamp, switching it on and off at apparently random intervals. She cranes up at the recessed skylight, Room's only window. The irregular flashes of lamp-light reveal glimpses of this little world lined with cork: ten foot a side, seven foot high, gabled ceiling rising to ten foot. Clusters of Jack's and Ma's vivid drawings are pinned all over the walls, quivering in the draft from the vents. Done with five crayons (red, yellow, blue, orange, green) and pencil on toilet tissue, lined pages or cardboard, they show dogs, trees, aliens, rocket ships, figures labelled 'Jack' or 'Ma'. Delicate mobiles (uncooked spaghetti, threads, plastics, foil, down from pillows, cloth scraps) dangle. A wardrobe with slatted louver doors. On top, toys crafted from garbage, a Labyrinth from toilet-roll insides. A dresser with a TV. A homemade pack of cards, papier m\ufffdch\ufffd checkers and chess. A Fort constructed from vitamin and other bottles and cans. A single meagre African violet in a pot on the TV. A round dining table, two fold-up chairs side by side. A bath with a single small towel over the side. A toilet, with a flotilla of homemade toy boats floating in the tank which is oddly missing a lid. A sink, with a single worn toothbrush, toothpaste, dish soap, a broken comb, folded rags for washcloths. A small square of mirror tile hung up over it. A small kitchen cabinet. A dish rack: two each of big and small white plates, bowls, tumblers, knives, forks, spoons (one with a melted handle), a scissors, can opener, serrated knife, wooden spoon, spatula. A basic stove (with more folded rags on its handle, for pot holders), one frying pan and one saucepan. A small refrigerator (more toys on top), a tiny trash. (CONTINUED) 1 "

BOWMAN, painfully thin, with the perpetually surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than once, supervises the settings of the table.

Curious, Cathy walks up to the bush, which abruptly stops moving. A small, lizard-like animal, dark green with brown stripes along its back, steps out from the bush. Only about a foot tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail. It walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken. CATHY (CONT\u2019D) Well, hello there!

And indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the left pocket of the incredulous WOMAN's silk blazer. More laughter and applause. The study is in keeping with the rest of the house.

The proprietor of this room: CHARLIE SANDIN - lies asleep in bed. Light spills through blinds, waking him. He sits up, ready to start his day.

After a moment, the WATCH displays CHARLIE\u2019S HEART RATE (55) and TEMPERATURE (98.5). Charlie then picks up a CALENDAR BOOK - rifles through PAGES, on which we see that Charlie has written down his HEART RATE and TEMPERATURE every morning for the last 5 years. He reaches today\u2019s date, when his eyes fall on the page\u2019s HEADER - MARCH 21 - THE ANNUAL PURGE. And Charlie\u2019s face suddenly tightens with worry. Charlie writes down his VITALS, then abruptly closes the book - as if trying to hide the DATE that\u2019s unsettled him. But his expression tells us he isn\u2019t successful. Charlie then stands and approaches his DRESSER. He opens a DRAWER, rifles through clothes, and does something odd; he puts on another t-shirt over his shirt. He then puts on yet another t-shirt over that. And he\u2019s not finished; Charlie puts on two more pairs of underwear. And as he stands there, all layered up, we notice that Charlie\u2019s a handsome boy, but there\u2019s something strange about him, in the way he moves, the way he stares off. Charlie then proceeds to his CLOSET. He opens it and strangely walks INTO the closet, disappearing between HANGING CLOTHES - when his skinny arm reaches back and closes the closet door - shutting us out - and himself in for some reason. 3.

The boy runs off and the old man pulls himself to his feet to follow. The old man walks to the base of the mound where another man who looks in command is there to greet him. MAN (In Iraqi language) Some interesting finds. Lamps, arrow-heads, coins... The old man picks up an old pendant and holds it up. MERRIN (In Iraqi language) This is strange! The man dusts the pendant and takes a look. MAN (In Iraqi language) Not of the same period. The old man reaches into a hole in the rock, moving and re- arranging small rocks to see what he can find. He grabs a pickaxe and scrapes out a small sculpted piece of rock crushed into another.

The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle. The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is fighting. In the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black. The white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA. He is thirty years old. His face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black hair shines and hangs in his eyes. Rocky fights in a plodding, machine-like style. The BLACK FIGHTER dances and bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy. But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead. The people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for blood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters. In the thick smoke they resemble spectres. Everyone is hustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony. A housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet.

Glimpses of tinsel, and a transparent peignoir momentarily hide a large pair of sagging breasts swinging from side to side and bouncing up and down. Dead silence as the movement gradually speeds up to real time. We slowly pull back to reveal that our image is that of a giant nude woman dressed in nothing but tiny bits of glitter, white vinyl boots and a small tulle cape. She is gyrating madly and flinging her head around in some sort of windstorm. As we pull back further we come to understand that what we are looking at is an art installation: a floor to ceiling LCD screen. The sound of breathing. A close up of a woman\u2019s eyes now fills our screen. SUSAN MORROW, 42, handsome. Sleek. There is a very slight hint of panic on her face as she stares across the crowded, brightly lit room. Abruptly our sound snaps on at a deafening decibel level as we hear what seems like a thousand voices screaming over each other. The screens cover the four walls of the gallery and the effect of wall to wall, floor to ceiling breast and ass jiggling is oddly impressive. The obese women on the LCD screens are nude but dressed in bits and pieces of Americana: one is playing the part of a cheerleader with red tinsel pom poms, one a majorette twirling a baton while another wears a beauty queen\u2019s ribbon and waves small American flags. They taunt us and tease us. On raised plinths scattered around the room are incredibly life like sculptures of seemingly the same corpulent women on our video screens. These women appear to be dead and are lying face down. Nude except for jewelry, shoes and small bits of tinsel wrapped around their ankles and waists.

The wind whips through their long hair. At the edge of the clearing, WILL (20), a young ranger dressed all in black, surveys the grim scene from the back of his gelding. He gathers his reins and guides his horse south. EXT. FOREST - DUSK Will rides hard between the towering pines, his horse's hooves kicking up fresh-fallen snow. He comes to a halt and dismounts beside two tethered horses. His comrades, GARED (50) and SER WAYMARR OYCE (18), crouch beside a stream, filling their skins with cold water. They rise and look to the newcomer expectantly. Ser Waymar is gray-eyed and graceful, with an aristocrat's air of command despite his youth. He wears a supple coat of gleaming black ringmail and a lush sable cloak. Will and Gared also wear the black of the Night's Watch, but their clothes are far less regal, their leather and fur battered from hard usage. Gared wears a hood for warmth. WILL We should start back. They're all dead. Gared offers Will his water skin and Will takes a drink. SER WAYMAR Any blood? WILL Not that I saw. SER WAYMAR How close did you get?

Beside the bed, a Blackberry thrums into life, on vibrate. From the bed, a man\u2019s hand blearily reaches for the Blackberry, but manages instead to knock it onto the carpet, where it continues to thrum away. He grunts slightly. The Blackberry stops humming. For a moment, all is quiet again. Then another phone rings: an office desk phone, beside the bed. Sighing, he reaches over and switches on a lamp. Now we see him: Michael Callow: early forties. His wife Jane rolls over, pulls the covers up around her. Glancing at the clock beside the bed (5.13am), Michael lifts the receiver with a faintly resigned, apprehensive air. MICHAEL Hello. He listens. MICHAEL (CONT\u2019D) Just tell me what\u2019s happened. He listens. Whoever\u2019s on the phone is saying something, but not giving him the basics: what is happening?

On the shower floor -- A HAPHAZARD PILE OF SMALL METAL DISCS. Each disc about the size of a cervical vertebrae, and roughly the same shape; thick in the center, tapering on the edges. Smeared with blood and flecks of bone. The discs are CORTICAL DATASTACKS, simply called STACKS. The Man -- call him ORIGINAL (O.G.) KOVACS -- detaches the showerhead, starts rinsing the stacks.

It's not that they're faster or stronger than other fish. They're just touched by something extra. Call it luck. Call it grace. One such fish was The Beast. The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms. Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun. Past a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried. EDWARD (V.O.) By the time I was born, he was already a legend. He'd taken more hundred- dollar lures than any fish in Alabama.

REPORTER'S VOICE The antenna will allow us to listen in, across the galaxy, through gravitational waves--seen as the ultimate means of communication through space. Now: footage of MACHINES going this way and that, spinning a lattice of tethers. They're almost like spiders on a web. Or HYDRAS, with CYCLOPS-LIKE BRIGHT LIGHTS in their centers. REPORTER'S VOICE Self-replicators are used for its construction. And it's not just machines; a select few highly- trained folks from the Army Corps of Engineers will have to check every inch of the carbon fiber for flaws. It has proven one of the most demanding jobs on Earth, but these men and women are up to the task. Engineer Major Roy McBride of Las Cruces, New Mexico, says he's not afraid of the challenge"

A young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his tousled hair frosted white. JACK (V.O.) But then...then I saw the moon. It was so big and it was so bright, and it seemed to chase the darkness away. And when it did...I wasn't scared anymore. Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up underneath him. JACK (V.O.) Why I was there, and what I was meant to do - that I've never known. And a part of me wonders if I ever will. Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight as it dims a bit. Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd. Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 2. Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across the ice. Jack is visibly confused.

He raises a jagged razor to his face, RAKES it across his right cheek, drawing BLOOD. He does not flinch. The sharp SCRAPING of the jagged blade against skin is the first SOUND we hear. VALLON cuts himself similarly on the left cheek, then hands the razor ceremoniously to a BOY standing beside him. The boy, no more than twelve years old, looks at VALLON worshipfully, keen eyes shining with fear and excitement. He starts to wipe the razor blade on the bottom of his jacket. VALLON No. Never. The blood stays on the blade, son. He hands the boy a dark red velvet pouch. Very carefully, the boy, known as AMSTERDAM, wraps the razor up, hands it back to his father. From the shadows, VALLON now raises a long pole with a beautiful golden crucifix mounted on the end, then holds his free hand out to his son. Amsterdam squeezes tight. VALLON nods toward the door. Amsterdam pulls it open. Outside is a dim hallway. We hear SOUNDS that might be animal or human. MUSIC begins: a steady, driving cadence somewhere between a march and a hymn. CUT TO 2 INT.

We can see the rear of a number of assorted houses and small apartment buildings whose fronts face on the next cross-town street, sharply etched by the morning sun. Some are two stories high; others three; some have peaked roofs, others are flat. There is a mixture of brick and wood and wrought iron in the construction. The apartment buildings have fire escapes, the others do not. The neighborhood is not a prosperous one, but neither is it poor. It is a practical, conventional dwelling place for people living on marginal incomes, luck -- or hope and careful planning. The summer air is motionless and heavy with humid heat. It has opened windows wide, pushed back curtains, lifted blinds and generally brought the neighborhood life into a sweltering intimacy. Yet, people born and bred to life within earshot and eye glance of a score of neighbors have learned to preserve their own private worlds by uniformly ignoring each other, except on direct invitation. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK until a large sleeping profile of a man fills the screen. It is so large that we do not see any features, but merely the temple and side of the cheek down which a stream of sweat is running. THE CAMERA PANS OFF this to the right hand side of the window, and MOVES TO a thermometer which is hanging on the wall just outside the window. It registers 84. THE CAMERA MOVES ON into the open, and brings nearer to us a room with a large studio window. We are able to see inside this room. A short, balding man is standing near the window, shaving, using a small bowl of water and a portable mirror which he has set up on a shelf. To the right of him is a battered upright piano.

DAWN. 1 In the early morning dawn, the Skykomish River in Washington State's Cascade Mountain Range pounds against the granite river rocks. Giant Fir branches in the lush forest undulate, almost dancing in the soft wind. A BLACK-TAILED BUCK makes its way through the dense woods. The deer walks to the bank, dips its mouth into the river, and drinks. Tall grass parts and out of the morning fog comes a young man, completely COVERED IN MUD, a massive, serrated hunting knife in his hands. This is BODEVAN. He's 18, with wispy hair down to his shoulders. The deer turns its head, sensing something. Bo freezes - perfectly camouflaged in the tall grass. The deer sniffs the air, but as Bo is covered in mud and animal skins, it smells nothing. It relaxes, drinking from the river again. Bo exhales, silently. In a flash, Bo leaps out of the grass and in one continuous motion, tackles the deer and slices the animal\u2019s carotid artery. The deer does nothing more than flinch, blood spurts from it\u2019s neck and it just folds, hemorrhagic shock taking over. It's a perfect kill. Bo watches and the animal takes its final breath. Then he signals and five KIDS glide into the clearing. They range in age from 14 to 6, all have long, unruly hair, dirty faces, and wear, over the usual kid's clothes of t-shirts and jeans, what looks like animal skins. They are: two twin 15- year old girls, KIELYR and VESPYR; RELLIAN, a boy of 13; ZAJA, a 8-year old girl; and lastly, NAI, a 6-year old boy. The other kids surround Bo, staring down at the fallen deer.

We are looking down at a rough brick floor ... is it an alley? ... a cobblestone street? ... a warehouse? a factory? ... we're not sure... The flickering glow of flame is the only illumination... The ominous organ music continues as... From the bottom of the frame... A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up the frame, defying gravity ... the flickering flame reflected in the blood... Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame. SUDDENLY-- A shrill factory whistle blows-- ENORMOUSLY LOUD -- blood-chilling and spine-shattering -- the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound: a factory whistle; a hog being slaughtered; a dog snarling; a roaring inferno; a human scream-- And a man's face appears, upside down, reflected in the pool of blood. He is THE GENTLEMAN, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and matching waistcoat. A cold and superior aristocrat. The camera slowly revolves -- the Gentleman becoming right side up as-- GENTLEMAN Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd. His skin was pale and his eye was odd. He shaved the faces of gentlemen Who never thereafter were heard of again. He trod a path that few have trod, Did Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. We cut from the blood to see the Gentleman standing before us. Strangely impassive. We are in an eerie dark chamber, unclear, a low ceiling, a world of silhouettes and shadows.

There is a long, wide corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and battleships. The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are clean and bright. A small easel sits stored in the corner. Outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling the gutters. A ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. He is Lionel. Lionel slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. He takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove. A child's voice says over the speaker: RECORD PLAYER (V.O.) In order to show you how a big symphony orchestra is put together, Benjamin Britten has written a big piece of music, which is made up of smaller pieces that show you all the separate parts of the orchestra. As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their bedrooms and down to the landing. The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten. The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. They lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their fists, listening. Suzy sits in the windowsill. She opens a book called Shelly and the Secret Universe. There is an illustration on the cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her neck. Suzy starts to read -- then pauses. She lowers her book. She raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. She looks out into the rain. 2. EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE.

Wooden planks nailed to the side face us, as if it were a ladder leading to an unseen tree house. FOUR ROPES ascend into the tree and disappear out of frame. Each rope is tied to one of FOUR PEOPLE: two adults and two children - clearly a family. The four are standing with their HANDS BOUND and BURLAP SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS. There is no slack in the ropes; in fact, they are pulled so tight that the family has to stand on their tiptoes to breathe. We watch the footage silently for ten, maybe even twenty seconds. In the top right corner of the frame we can see what looks like A HANDSAW BLADE poking in and out, as if it is sawing a branch. A MASSIVE BRANCH FALLS. Each of the four ropes are tied to it, and are clearly strung over another branch higher in the tree, so ALL FOUR PEOPLE ARE HOISTED IMMEDIATELY INTO THE AIR, their legs thrashing against the sudden strangulation. The bodies flail, choking to death before they each, one by one, succumb and die.

The camera reveals a massive shadow, and then... an Apatosaurus, walking across his farm. This is HENRY. BOOM! Henry uses his tail to knock down a tree. He adds it to a large pile. He digs his snout into the ground, plows long furrows into the tough dirt. Alongside Henry is his hardworking Apatosaurus wife, IDA, carrying a yoke of seeds. She scatters them into the fresh furrows. DISSOLVE TO: Small sprouts grow in rows across the field. Henry dips his head into the river, gets a mouthful of water. He turns back toward the crops, sprays the water through his teeth across the rows. IDA (O.S.) Henry! Henry turns toward the cabin. IDA It\u2019s time! Henry\u2019s face lights up. INT.

Strange ghostly forms appear and disappear in the distance. They seem like apparitions. Broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky light. We see hints of a huge demolished space. An old white plaster wall FILLS THE SCREEN. Momentary blips of light flash across it. SOUNDS of street traffic are heard dimly in the distance. With startling impact, the SOUND of a sledgehammer explodes out of nowhere. The wall shudders. HAMMER BLOWS assault the audience. They are loud and jarring. The wall buckles. Chunks of plaster CRASH to the floor. The air fills with new swirls of white dust. The SLEDGEHAMMER smashes INTO VIEW. Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the atmosphere like searchlights in a fog. A huge section of wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the air. We hear voices talking. MOLLY (O.S.) What a mess! SAM (O.S.) I told you! Through jagged holes we can make out three dim figures on the other side of the wall, all wielding SLEDGEHAMMERS. SAM I can't breathe. MOLLY Use your mask, dummy. One of the figures adjusts something over his face. Isolated rays of sunlight dance around him casting long shadows in the air. SAM (singing) \"Volga boat..., man.\" Whoomph! His hammer pounds the wall. Molly laughs. ANGLE The CAMERA MOVES IN and for the first time we see them. MOLLY JENSEN, in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful. SAM WHEAT, in his late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong forehead and handsome features. Sweat is dripping down his brow, leaving streaks in the dust. CARL BRUNER, early 30's, removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a fashionable two-day stubble. Both men have their shirts off. CUT TO: ANGLE BLACKNESS AND A L"

The HEAD TITLES start to roll, in- terrupted by weird, translucent figures taking shape on the screen. They are the ghostly inhabitants of a world of shadows, bowing and danc- ing in the lamplight at the whim of a clever puppeteer, acting out the old story of Rama and Ravana to the music of the Gamelin, the Chinese band - bells, drums, and a xylo- phone. There are only a few scattered spec- tators, drowsing to the lullaby and watching the twitching puppets through half-closed eyes. Bricks show through the flaking paint of the walls. At the back, a huge, pink, frescoed Buddha holds the floor of the theater in his lap like a tray. Suddenly, one of the two side doors leading to the alley swings open with a SLAM that sends a ripple through the music of the band. THREE BRUISERS loom into view, banging the door behind them. No-one pays any at- tention except an old CHINESE LADY, obviously employed in the place, who has just come down a stairway hidden at the back and watches the three men with beady black eyes. One of the men - PASQUALE - stands guard by the door. The other two pick an aisle and move down it. But they're not looking for good seats. 2 They peer at the faces in the audience, dim in the flickering light...a quick, professional once-over that doesn't hide the violence under the skin.

A shape lies in the street below the busted-out porch railing of a two-story building. A sign identifies the building as the Monarch Boarding House. Papa was a Cumberland Presbyterian and a Mason. He'd hired Chaney--for paid wages, not on shares--when Chaney was \"down on his luck.\" If Papa had a failing it was his kindly disposition; I did not get my mean streak from him. The crumpled shape is a body. We hear the thunder of approaching hooves. He had taken Chaney up to Fort Smith to help lead back a string of mustang ponies he'd just bought from a stock trader named Stonehill. In town, Chaney had fallen to drink and cards, and lost all his money. He got it into his head he'd been cheated and went back to the boarding house for his Henry rifle. Papa remonstrated, and Chaney shot him in the breast. A galloping horse enters frame and recedes, whipped on by a bareback rider.

Three MEN step out of each SUV and surveil the area: the PEDESTRIANS passing by on the sidewalk, the traffic in the street, even the rooftops. None of the six bodyguards is particularly large, they don't have razor scars on their faces, their scalps are no longer shaved-- but even if you didn't know they were ex paramilitary, you would know enough to step out of their way.

Still wiry and fit, his blue eyes fierce as a wolf's, Borz has the authoritative bearing of a man who has been giving orders for thirty years.

RAY KROC Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhat the heck do I need a five- spindle for? I barely sell enough shakes to justify my single spindle.\u201d Right? Wrong. (BEAT) Mr. Paulsen, are you familiar with the notion of the chicken and the egg? I mention it because I believe it\u2019s applicable here: Do you not need a Multimixer because you\u2019re not selling enough milk shakes? Or are you not selling enough milk shakes because you don\u2019t have a Multimixer? I firmly believe it\u2019s the latter. You see, your customers, they know that if they order a shake from your establishment, it\u2019s going to be a terrific wait. They\u2019ve ordered one before, and by golly they\u2019re not gonna make that mistake again. But if you had, say, a Prince Castle- brand five-spindle Multimixer with patented direct-drive electric motor, you could greatly increase your ability to produce delicious, frosty milk shakes fast. And before long, mark my words, dollars to donuts, you\u2019d be selling more of those suckers than you can shake a stick at. Increase supply, demand will follow. Chicken and the egg. You follow my logic? Of course you do. You\u2019re a bright, forward- thinking fella who knows a good idea when he hears it. (BEAT) So whaddaya say? ON THE OWNER-- pondering thoughtfully. OWNER Nah.

The conversation included Wes Anderson, Jason Schwartzman, Roman Coppola, Kunichi Nomura, and Faber\u2019s editor, Walter Donohue How do four people write a script? WALTER We learned from our colleague Lauren that in his writers\u2019 room WES Kurosawa had one special collaborator named Oguni who was called \u2013 what was the name of it? The Command Tower. ROMAN Kurosawa and his co-writer or team of co-writers worked WES together to form the initial ideas and scenes of the films \u2013 but, as they progressed, they would periodically show them to the Command Tower, Mr Oguni. He would then tell them what was good, what was bad \u2013 basically critique their work and steer them back on track when they were off the rails. And that\u2019s how they shaped the scripts. It\u2019s quite a common thing in Italian cinema as well \u2013 writers working in teams. I think more or less all the Fellini movies and the Rossellini and the DeSica and the Pietro Germi: you even see their names on each others\u2019 movies. I think maybe even Pasolini worked on Nights of Cabiria. Anyway, obviously, it can be a good system! We\u2019ve worked together on several scripts. Kun, of course, is the only one among us who is actually Japanese. Half the movie is in Japanese, and it\u2019s set there, and Kun is the only one who actually knows what anyone is saying. He translated most of it and helped us try to always look to Japan as the inspiration for our little reality. Was it all four of you at the same time or just three of you WALTER working up the story? Well, even going way back to our earlier collaborations on ROMAN The Darjeeling Limited and Moonrise Kingdom, so much of it seems to start with life stories. "

We glide over the treetops, floating just above their peaks as a light snow falls, the flakes corkscrewing lazily away. All seems peaceful, silent. Then we notice a strange light playing against the fresh powder. Red, then blue. Then red again. We crest a final stand of trees to reveal: AN ENTIRE ENCAMPMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, some three hundred or so police, fire and ambulance, situated in what appears to be the middle of nowhere. From this angle, directly overhead, the SQUAD CARS and SWAT VANS almost look like toys. Nothing moves. The POLICE OFFICERS and SWAT Team members, hunkered down in firing positions, point their weapons at something unseen. We tilt from our isolating top-down view to reveal that this paramilitary phalanx is surrounding: a MODEST FARMHOUSE. It's a standoff of some kind, clearly. Then we see an ANT-SIZED FIGURE moving urgently across this frozen tableau. We slowly zoom in on the ant, revealing him to be a MAN IN A WINDBREAKER.

Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the forest. Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth oak rests directly in its path. The tree is uprooted by this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash. 2 ED - CAR Near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of a mountain. The road winds off into oblivion beyond other peaks. From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be heard. It is a large logging truck headed south. Moving away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap- pears in the distance. From where the truck emerged, a dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view. 3 ID - CAR Inside, five people can be seen. They are couples ASHLY and LINDA, SCOTT and SHELLY, and CHERYL, ASHLY's sister. Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear \"Michigan State\" T-shirts, and are students along with the others at that univer- sity. SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up front. ASHLY, LINDA and CHERYL are in back. They listen to an old \"Baby Moses And The Thrillers\" song on the radio, and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it were a drum. SHELLY (Singing with the music)... Together, forever...

Alone in a red corner booth is DON DRAPER, early 30's, handsome, conservative, and despite his third old fashioned, he is apparently sober. He is doodling on a cocktail napkin. He crosses something out, puts down his fountain pen, and taps a cigarette out of a pack of \"Lucky Strike\". The BUSBOY, a middle-aged black man, too old for his tight uniform, approaches.

As the camera begins a slow pan across the Heavens -- NARRATOR'S VOICE There is a sixth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space, and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow -- between man's grasp and his reach; between science and superstition; between the pit of his fears and the sunlight of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area that might be called the Twilight Zone. The camera has begun to pan down until it passes the horizon and is flush on the opening shot (each week the opening shot of the play). We are now looking down the small two-lane asphalt highway. It is dawn, the road is deserted save for a small diner on the left hand side. A broken neon light flashes on and off over the front door. From inside the sound of a rock-'n'-roll record lends a strange, raucous dissonance to the early morning silence. Then the camera sweeps right for a LONG SHOT MIKE FERRIS Who suddenly appears, walking down the road. His step is tentative, unsure. He's a tall man in his thirties. His dress is nondescript, his only identifiable garment being army pants. There's an indecisiveness, a puzzlement, in his features as he comes closer to the camera, sees the diner, stops, rubs his knuckles over the side of his face and feels his beard's stubble. He pats in his pocket, unsure, reaches in and pulls out a couple of dollar bills. For some reason this buoys him up. He looks a little more resolved as he walks up the steps and into the diner. NARRATOR'S VOICE We are looking at a male Caucasian, age approximately thirty-one, height approximately 5'11\". As to his name, where he is, and what he's doing there -- this even he doesn't know. For the journey that this man will take is an excursion into the shadows, and all of you are invited to go along. DISSOLVE TO: OPENI"

MAX No. Nothing. I heard Tokyo has power. Berlin, too. But they're just rumors. JOSEPH Nobody's connected? MAX No. No phone. No internet. No power. Nothing. They walk in silence, both lost in thought. Max takes in the lifeless machines all around them. JOSEPH You know we're rebuilding the same system? Max goes silent.

The stillness is broken by a MAN using a hand saw to cut wood. A WOMAN installs a new frame for their breached front door. They stop and watch Max. Suspicious.

This universe as alien to us as it is serenely hypnotic. The voice we hear is female. Dignified and soothing. JAINA (V.O.) At the beginning, the immortal Titans created the cosmos. Seeding it with light and with life. Bringing order to chaos. We're aware of a STRANGE ENERGY moving with us among the planets and stars. Like a shadow, dark ribbons of energy unlike any cosmic phenomenon we recognize. JAINA (V.O.) But even among immortals, there is discord. The great Titan champion Sargeras, once charged with protecting the worlds they had created from the powers of darkness, fell from grace and was cast out from their pantheon. Left to wander the Great Dark, alone. As we follow the ribbons of energy, they begin to take on darkly malevolent shapes. Almost as though sentient, alive. JAINA (V.O.) Embittered and vengeful, Sargeras vowed to destroy all that the Titans had created. He marshalled the very forces that he had once fought against to create the Burning Legion - a vast army of the demonic, the infernal, the corrupt. The ribbons of energy pass by vibrant, life-filled planets. And as they do so the planets become discolored and dark, as though a WAVE OF CORRUPTION is passing over them. JAINA (V.O.) The Legion travelled to world after world, spreading their corruption. Turning peace into war. Love into hate. Order back into chaos. We move ahead of the ribbons' path to find a NEW WORLD, one as yet untouched by the Legion's corruption. Moving closer, into the planet's orbit. A dark, featureless sphere. 2. JAINA (V.O.) Only one world remains unclaimed by the Legion. One crafted by the hands of the Titans themselves, their most ancient and precious jewel. And Sargeras's final, most coveted prize. The SUN RISES over the horizon, bathing the planet in light. Revealing vast oceans and continents teeming with life. Azeroth. JAINA (V.O.) As we mo"

His CUT MAN jabs coagulant into the wound; looks up to the manager standing over him. CUT MAN I can't stop it. The manager, FRANKIE DUNN, pushes him aside. FRANKIE Get outta the building, you useless tit. Frankie drops to one knee and we see his face. It's a face that could only have been cast by generations of potatoeaters, the kind of face that survives famines and frustrates invaders. Look deep into his eyes and you can see this man has been knocked to his knees, but he's always come up before the count. Always will. Frankie picks up the kit and goes to work on Big Willie. We're mesmerized by Frankie's hands. It's like watching a top surgeon going for a world speed record. SCRAP V.O. When I met him he was already the best cut man in the business. Started training and managing in the 60's, but he never lost his gift. Frankie cleans and flushes the wound with an adrenaline solution, uses his thumbs to work the blood away from the gash and packs it with a coagulant-rich salve. You stop it?
